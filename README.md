# clj-puppetdb

A Clojure library for accessing the [PuppetDB](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest) [REST API](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/api/index.html).

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/clj-puppetdb/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/clj-puppetdb)

Highlights:

1. Supports HTTPS with [Puppet's certificates](#create-a-new-connection-with-ssl-using-puppets-certificates).
2. Provides syntactic sugar for [PuppetDB queries](#writing-puppetdb-queries).
3. Results come back as a lazy sequence of maps with keywordized keys.
4. Supports paged queries, which come back as a complete (but lazy) set of results.

## Usage

I intend for this library to be pretty simple. There are basically three things to consider: connecting, sending a request to an endpoint, and writing queries.

### Connecting

Both HTTP and HTTPS connections are supported.

#### Create a new connection without SSL

The `clj-puppetdb.core/connect` function minimally requires a host URL, including the protocol and port:

```clojure
(ns clj-puppetdb.ssl-example
  (:require [clj-puppetdb.core :as pdb]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]))

(def client (pdb/connect "http://puppetdb:8080"))
```

If you're connecting over plain HTTP, no other options are supported.

#### Create a new connection with SSL (using Puppet's certificates)

If you want to connect to PuppetDB more securely, clj-puppetdb supports using SSL certificates. If you're running clj-puppetdb from a node that's managed by Puppet, you'll already have the certificates you need. Just supply them in a map after the host URL:

```clojure
(ns clj-puppetdb.ssl-example
  (:require [clj-puppetdb.core :as pdb]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]))

;; The certname for this node is "clojure"

(def certs
  {:ssl-ca-cert (io/file "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem")
   :ssl-cert (io/file "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/clojure.pem")
   :ssl-key (io/file "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/clojure.pem")})

(def client (pdb/connect "https://puppetdb:8081" certs))
```

A couple of things to note here:

* The certs are located under Puppet's SSLDIR, the location of which varies depending on OS and configuration. Use `sudo puppet config print ssldir` to find the location on your system.
* The certs must be supplied as instances of `java.io.File`, not simply paths/strings.
* If you're running clj-puppetdb on a node that isn't managed by Puppet, grab the files from a node that is. It'll still work.


#### Create a new connection with VCR support

VCR functionality is also supported in clj-puppetdb. If enabled, the first time a particular query is executed, a real
HTTP request is made to PuppetDB and the response is recorded. All future executions of the same query
result in no HTTP request with the response instead replayed from the recording. This can be useful for
testing or demo purposes as it allows clj-puppetdb to be run in a realistic manner without requiring a real PuppetDB,
after the initial recording has been made.

Enable the VCR by indicating the directory in which you'd like to store the recordings. Specifying a VCR directory
implicitly enables the VCR.

```clojure
(def client (pdb/connect "https://puppetdb:8080" {:vcr-dir "recordings/tests"}}))
```

### Simple requests

Once you've got a connection (`conn` in the below examples), you can pass it to `clj-puppetdb.core/query` along with a path:

```clojure
(pdb/query client "/v4/facts") ;; return all known facts
(pdb/query client "/v4/facts/operatingsystem") ;; return the "operatingsystem" fact for all nodes
```

The only real restriction on using the `query` function like this is that the path must be URL-encoded. You can query any version of any endpoint.

### Writing PuppetDB queries

The `query` function also supports [PuppetDB queries](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/api/query/v4/query.html) with a tiny bit of syntactic sugar:

```clojure
;; To find all Linux nodes with more than 30 days of uptime:
(pdb/query client "/v4/nodes" [:and
                              [:= [:fact "kernel"] "Linux"]
                              [:> [:fact "uptime_days"] 30]])
```

Here are some notes/caveats:

* Keywords, symbols, strings, numbers, regex literals, etc. all work and _are generally interchangeable_. For the sake of clarity, I recommend using keywords for operators and keys.
* The `~` operator is definitely an exception. Because it's a [reader macro character](http://clojure.org/reader#The%20Reader--Macro%20characters), you can't use it in a symbol or keyword. Instead, use the string `"~"` or the keyword `:match`, which will be converted automatically.
* If you're having a hard time getting your query to work, you can use `clj-puppetdb.query/query->json` to see the JSON representation of your query vector.
* The excellent [PuppetDB Query Tutorial](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/api/query/tutorial.html) has tons of great information and examples. Since JSON arrays are generally valid Clojure vectors, you can actually copy/paste those examples directly into a call to `clj-puppetdb.core/query`.

### Making paged queries

For queries that may return an extremely large set of results, clj-puppetdb supports [paged queries](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/api/query/v4/paging.html). The `clj-puppetdb.core/lazy-query` function behaves much like `clj-puppetdb.core/query`, but for these important differences:

1. You must also supply a map containing the  `:limit` and `:order-by` keys.
2. Results are requested from the PuppetDB server only as they are consumed.

#### Paged query examples

Here's a simple example of a paged query:

```clojure
(ns clj-puppetdb.paging-example
  (:require [clj-puppetdb.core :as pdb]))


(def certs
  {:ssl-ca-cert (io/file "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem")
   :ssl-cert (io/file "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/clojure.pem")
   :ssl-key (io/file "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/clojure.pem")}

(def client (pdb/connect "https://puppetdb:8081" certs))

(def lazy-facts
  (pdb/lazy-query client "/v4/facts"
    {:limit 500 :offset 0 :order-by [{:field :name :order "asc"}]}))
```

The map of parameters at the end of the call to `lazy-query` is worth unpacking a bit:
- The `:limit` key is **required**, and determines how many results to return at a time.
- The `:offset` key is optional (default is 0) and determines how many results to skip at the beginning of the query.
- The `:order-by` key is **required**, and sorts the results on the server-side. It consists of a vector of maps, where each map specifies a `:field` to sort by (e.g., `:certname` or `:value`) and either `"asc"` for ascending order or `"desc"` for descending order.

You can also supply a query vector:

```clojure
(def lazy-linux-nodes
  (pdb/lazy-query client "/v4/nodes" [:= [:fact "kernel"] "Linux"]
    {:limit 500 :order-by [{:field :certname :order "asc"}]}))
```

## Planned Features

Here are some things that I'm working on that will hopefully make this library a bit more robust:

* Handle HTTP(S) connections a bit better. Cache the certificates for SSL, do timeouts properly, etc.
* Validate queries before sending them off to the server.
